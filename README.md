## CFO Problem Definition
Carrier frequency offset (CFO) arises from the intrinsic mismatch between the oscillators of a wireless transmitter and the corresponding receiver, as well as their relative motion (i.e., Doppler effect). Despite advances in CFO estimation and tracking techniques, estimation errors are still present. Residual CFO creates a time-varying phase error, which degrades the decoderâ€™s performance by increasing the symbol error rate. The objective is estimate the CFO at a high-degree of accuracy using advanced machine learning techniques.
